### Technical Background
I have over a year of experience writing a variety of programs in Java and Python. Although primarily through college courses, I have also worked on a few **very** small scale personal projects, most of which are simple quality of life improvements to my windows workflow. The only relevant core programming classes I have taken up until this semester are CIS162 and CIS163, but I have done lots of research and practice in my own time. I am currently enrolled in CIS241 this semester. For non-programming skills relevant to this class, I have a lot of experience in composing and music production (DAW's), and have strong photo and video editing foundations.
